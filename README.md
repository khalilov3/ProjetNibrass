# Project Spring and microservices

## Monolithic Application

We created an application that focuses on ticket booking for flights.

On the server side we used Spring Boot and created a CRUD application for the classes like below:

* Planes named Avion
* Tickets named Ticket
* Flights named Vol
* Clients name Client

we created also the necessary APIs in order to make a communication between the front and back End.

The front application runs on the port 3000 and it is written using Reactjs. In order to run in just Open the terminal in the folder and type

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Microservices

**To push:**
```
git add .
git commit -m "name_commit"
